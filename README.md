# Coding-Quiz-Challenge

## Your Task

At some point in your journey to become a full-stack web developer, you’ll likely be asked to complete a coding assessment&mdash;perhaps as part of an interview process. A typical coding assessment includes both multiple-choice questions and interactive coding challenges. 

To help familiarize you with these tests and allow you to use the skills covered in this unit, this week’s homework invites you to build a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. It will have a clean, polished, and responsive user interface. 

This week’s coursework will equip you with all the skills you need to succeed in this assignment.

## User Story

```
AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and my score
```


## The Process

- Referred to the mock clip to get an understanding of the quiz and it's content and functions
- Googled a ton:
    - button onclick in html because I found it easier than in JavaScript
    - flexbox and css styling techniques
    - w-3 schools helped with setting timer and stopping
    - blocking and showing questions and answers
    - var vs. let (every resource I read says developers rarely use var so I'm using let for now on)
    - REALLY struggled with local storage and JSON. Never got it to work hints why high score and initials don't show up on screen, but they do show up in console.
- a very challenging hw assignment
- watched class videos over and over 
- Honestly surprised I got as much to work as I did. Simply couldn't figure out the rest. I find myself more confused now than I was before. Ran out of time and had to stop for the sake of my mental health! Wish I could have done more...
